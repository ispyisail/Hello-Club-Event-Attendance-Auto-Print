Program Scope: Next Event Attendee Printout1. ObjectiveTo create a command-line tool in Node.js that automatically finds the next upcoming event, retrieves its full attendee list, and formats it into a printable sign-up sheet that matches the provided PDF sample.The program will run automatically, without needing an event name as input. It will query the API for the single next event based on the current time.2. Development ApproachThe project will be built in small, incremental steps. Each step will focus on a single piece of functionality and will be tested to ensure it works correctly before the next step is started. This iterative, test-driven methodology ensures a robust and reliable final application.3. Iterative Development and Testing Plan üõ†Ô∏èThis plan breaks the project into small, verifiable milestones.Milestone 1: Establish API ConnectionGoal: Confirm that we can successfully authenticate with the Hello Club API.Action: Write a minimal script that makes a simple request (e.g., to /user/me) using your API key.Test ‚úÖ: The script successfully runs without errors and receives a 200 OK response, confirming the API key is valid.Milestone 2: Test the "Next Event" QueryGoal: Verify the logic for finding the single next event.Action: Write a script that calls the GET /event endpoint with the following parameters:fromDate: The current date and time.sort: startDatelimit: 1Test ‚úÖ: The script prints a single event object to the console. Manually verify this is the correct upcoming event.Milestone 3: Test the "Get Attendees" QueryGoal: Confirm we can retrieve attendees for a known event.Action: Hardcode the id from the event found in Milestone 2. Write a script that calls the GET /eventAttendee endpoint for that specific id.Test ‚úÖ: The script prints an array of attendee objects to the console.Milestone 4: Test Pagination LogicGoal: Ensure the program can retrieve a complete attendee list, even if it spans multiple API pages.Action: Using the same event from Milestone 3, modify the script to set the limit parameter to a small number (e.g., limit=3). The script must loop using the offset parameter until it has fetched all attendees.Test ‚úÖ: The script prints a final array containing the total number of attendees for the event, proving the pagination logic works.Milestone 5: Test Data FormattingGoal: Verify that the data processing and text formatting logic is correct without making live API calls.Action: Copy a few attendee objects from the output of Milestone 4 and save them as a hardcoded array. Write a function that takes this array and the event details and formats it into the final table layout.Test ‚úÖ: The function correctly prints a fully formatted header and table to the console, with all columns (Name, Phone, Fee, Status) properly aligned and calculated.Milestone 6: Final Integration TestGoal: Run the complete, end-to-end program.Action: Combine the code from all previous milestones into the final application. The program should now run with a single command, performing all steps automatically.Test ‚úÖ: The program successfully executes, finds the next event, retrieves all its attendees, and prints the perfectly formatted sign-up sheet.4. Final Output ExampleThe final output printed to the console should look like this:==================================================================
